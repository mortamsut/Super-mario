The 'Super Mario' project is a sophisticated and engaging venture that involves the creation of a Mario game</br> 
using the C++ programming language. At its core, this project is an embodiment of advanced</br> 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, showcasing the application of robust design patterns to enhance the game's structure and functionality.</br> 
Throughout the development process, meticulous attention has been given to the utilization </br> 
of C++ to implement a well-organized and modular codebase. The incorporation of advanced OOP principles </br> 
ensures a scalable and maintainable architecture, allowing for seamless updates and additions to the game's features.</br> 
Furthermore, the project goes beyond conventional game development by integrating advanced Design Patterns.</br> 
These patterns, including but not limited to Singleton,Decorator, Observer, and Factory</br> 
patterns, contribute to the project's efficiency, flexibility, and extensibility. They are strategically</br> 
implemented to address specific challenges within the game, providing elegant solutions to complexdesign problems.</br> 
(In the meantime, there is a problem uploading the code because its size is very large)</br>
